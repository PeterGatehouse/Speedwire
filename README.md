Speedwire school fair game
Source code for PIC microcontroller of Speedwire. Specific to this hardware but just to keep it safe.
Revised June18th 2022 to be less confusing at end of game.
Open the .X folder in MPLAB X IDE v4.15 to get at the source and build settings. this needs the 16-bit compiler and libraries on the disk.
